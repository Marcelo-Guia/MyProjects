Welcome!

In here, you'll be able to see some of my projects from school and some I made myself at home. Some of these projects may be either 
incomplete, finished or in some cases be something I just tried out. The projects in Unity mostly reflect that, as in Unity I mostly
made projects to simply test an idea.

Structure:
Here you should be able to see 2 folders: IMS and Home. The IMS folder will contain projects which I made in school and the Home folder
will contain stuff I made at home. Keep in mind, that my projects at home, were mostly experimental and often will simply have a short
demo, like a top down view with a moving character or a working car in Unity written in C#. These such experiments mostly countain the
main thing itself and nothing else, because they are simply just something I tried out. The projects from the IMS are mostly finished as
they were part of the exams, but there may be one or two where I didn't quite make it to what I first imagined it to be before deadline. 
Also, since these are all projects I made over the years, some of them will inevitably be quite bad and others will be better. As the 
description says, this is supposed to show how I evolved over time in programming.

In each folder there'll be another ReadMe file, for you to keep tab on what the folder conteins and some descriptions of the projects are
also included. Enjoy the code!
