This is likely the school project I'm proudest of. The task was to make a game of any sort, in which you could edit data, that influences
the game and it had to have a working GUI. I first tried to make a somewhat complex detective game, but then later restartet and decided
to go for a combat game. The game consists of 3 characters, which the first and second player can freely choose. The game then starts a
round-based battle, where the first player to reach 0 HP loses. You can edit the names of the players, you can fully edit the characters
and their abilities and you have an interesting combat system. I have to admit, that it isn't very balanced, but that's the fun of it:
You as the player can balance it however you want. The data is saved in a text file for easy access for editing. I didn't really have 
any major issues with this one, other than a little inconvenience I had with trying to pass methods as parameters. The GUI is pretty good 
and the teacher was impressed with it, tho I haven't received my grade for it yet. The fact, that stamina can go below 0 is a design
choice: It is meant to be more and more punishing the further the player pushes his luck with it. Example: If the player is already at 0
stamina, if it was capped at 0, he could continue to attack and then decide to wait once to remove it's effects. With it uncapped, the
more the player decides to attack, the lower his stamina gets and the more he has to wait to actually remove it's effects. In conclusion
this project was very fun to work on and turned out almost exactly like I wanted it in it's second iteration.
