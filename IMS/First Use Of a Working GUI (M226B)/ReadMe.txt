This project was a 3 hour long exam, where we were tasked to create a management app for the bonuses of employees. This was also my first
working GUI in an exam. The goal was to have 5 functions in total: 

- Show a detailed list of all Bonuses
- Show a less detailed list of all bonuses
- Show the total amount of sales each year
- Show the amount of employees in the company
- Show the total amount of bonuses each year

I managed to make 4 out of those, but unfortunately didn't finish the less detailed list of all bonuses. Also since I ran out of time
during the exam, the lists only write the text on one line. But other than that, all the functions work as intended and all the 
calculations work. Also if you check the Home section, you'll see that I kept working on the project, I used to study for this exam, at 
home and eventually got a better grasp of GUIs in Java. Furthermore, the Fighting game (Module 326) I made for school shows how far I've
gotten with GUIs in Java, as it is my most recent Java project.
