This was my first object oriented exam after M404, an exam which went very badly for me, because I didn't really understand the concept
of object oriented programing and didn't have any better luck with diagrams... But I set myself out to learn it by myself using the 
exam template in the Home folder and managed to do a pretty good job as a result. This exam was (like M404) a 3 hour long exam, in which
we were supposed to program a mobile device management app. This was before we started working with GUIs, so the app is entirely on the
console. I made use of a menu we learned to make in class and used the template I made in the meantime to speed things up in this project.
I managed to finish everything except for the updating function, which was there from the template, but not adapted for the project as I
ran out of time. There was also an exception at the beginning of the program, which didn't influence how it worked, but I fixed it after 
exam. All in all, this project went very well and I scored a 5.5 in that exam. This was very important for me, as this exam was basically
a more advanced version of the M404 exam being heavily based o object oriented programing. So this alse served as a way for me to redeem
mself in the object oriented aspect of programing and I really enjoyed working with Java from this point on.
