This is my most recent home project. It started very recently as an idea to combine two of my interests in one: IT and Cars. The idea is to make a fully functioning engine, that calculates all the variables put in by the user, like bore, stroke, maybe even fuel etc., and uses those calculations to run just like a real engine would. After I'm done with the engine, I'll make a transmission for it, then I'll add wheels and a body etc. So in the end, this will fully simulate a car. At first my plan was to get all the formulas for calculations like torque, inertia, force etc. and then implement them accordingly. But after 2 weeks, all I've been doing is get those formulas together and search them (some of which are extremely hard to find) and as a result I haven't actually coded much yet. All I have at the moment is some of the formulas and most of the necessary variables. So this week (around 17th of November) I finally decided, that I'll make a simplified version of the code first, so that I don't get to caught up by the physics aspect of this program. I currently don't have the project created yet, but I'm already brainstorming how I'll implement the formulas I already have, with some made up formulas to somewhat achieve something close to what I tried in the complex version. Currently I already have formulas for Torque, Angular Acceleration, Force, Angular Velocity, Inertia, Area of the piston and the according unit conversion formulas. However to calculate the force exerted on the piston, I need the pressure created from combustion. And that is currently my biggest hurdle, as that requires a very complicated combination of a lot of variables, thermodynamics and physics, so I cannot progress there. I've been researching to find that formula for about 2 weeks now and still haven't found aything close enough. So currently I'm thinking of something like a point system, so that I can apply that to the simplied version in the meantime. Before I figure that out, the project is on hold for now. And my time is also limited due to school exams, school IT projects and job applications. So it may take some time to actually get those ideas on code.
