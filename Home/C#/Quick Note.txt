Just a quick note:
I planned to have here a working version of a car using wheel colliders from Unity, but unfortunately in a conversion from one Unity version to another, the project stopped working. The car had working suspension, was able to drive forward and backward and was able to turn both ways. It wasn't hooked up to a transmission tho and it was very basic, as it was my first try with simulating a car in Unity. I later hooked it up with the JCar script from another well-known user, but that never really took off and I felt as if it wasn't appropriate for what this repository is supposed to be, so i didn't upload it.
