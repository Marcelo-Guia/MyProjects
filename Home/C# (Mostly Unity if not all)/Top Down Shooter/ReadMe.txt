This was a project I planned to see if I was able to create a top down view shooter. At first I planned to make a mini RPG game, but as more school exams came about and I started losing time with that, it simply turned into a small challenge rather than an entire game. My goal was to make a moving character in a top down view, with which you can aim and shoot physical bullets. I then also wanted to add controller support to try it out, but as school exams started taking more time and I had other plans, I had to abandon it. I made a simple reticle for the controller and the controller can move it around, but I stopped working on it before I got to hook up the fire button for it. The game works as I intended it: The player can move using the traditional WASD keys. The camera follows the player and the character aims wherever the mouse is pointing (a ray is cast and the point at which the ground is touched is the point to aim at). In addition he aims slightly higher than the exact point, because if there were to be enemies in the game, that's where the player would point. Sadly I didn't get to make any enemies for it. The reticle is represented as a point on the screen and if a controller is properly connected, it can be used to move that point. If the controller is used, the reticle basically acts as the mouse. I may try to continue this project in the future, but right now I'm busy with job applications, school exams and the other Unity project I'm working on, so it'll have to wait. This project was made in the beginning of the 2nd year of the IMS, so there may be some errors from me not having much experience at the time.
