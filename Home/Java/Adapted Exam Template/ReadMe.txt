This is a template for exams, which I made at home by myself, using things I learned from school and research. This first started as a 
project for me to learn Object Oriented programing after I had some trouble with an exam. Over time I managed to learn Object Oriented 
programing and added other useful things like a time tool, which has a few functions already written in place. As I evolved this project,
 I started using it as a template for my Java exams, so I could save time. It's not meant to really do anything, it's only there to have 
a reference for other projects. And for that, it served me more than well enough for the duration in which we worked with Java. Do keep in
mind tho, that after we started working with GUIs I stopped updating it, as it was good enough for the programing side of things already.
Since I could simply use the Trafficlight code, which is also in the same folder as this one, I decided to keep the template as is and
work on the Trafficlight program instead. I could use bothnfor reference if I needed to.
