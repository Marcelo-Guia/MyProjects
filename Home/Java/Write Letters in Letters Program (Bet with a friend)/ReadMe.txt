This was my first Java project and it started out as a bet between me and a friend after we first learned, that we would be working with Java in the future. We came up with the task of writing letters in letters, like this example here:

    A      BBBB    CCC
   A A     B   B  C   C
  AAAAA    BBBB   C
 A     A   B   B  C   C
A       A  BBBB    CCC

The user is supposed to write an input consisting only out of letters and the program is then supposed to write them out like that. It was an easy task, but we were basically just starting out at the time and it ended up being a fun little competition. The bet went nowhere as both of us managed to get it working, but in ways so different from each other, that you couldn't really pick a winner. In terms of performance a comparison wasn't possible either, because I went for lightning quick output and he went for a beautyful slow printing of the letters, meaning we both went for a diferent goal. But the program works, is simple and was a very good introduction to Java in my opinion. Keep in mind, that at the time I hadn't learned object oriented programing yet.
